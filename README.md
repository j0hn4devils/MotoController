# MotoController
Project for NXP KL46. Goal of project is to create sequential LED turn signals and an alarm system
that are to be used on motorcycles. Project is currently in early stages. As I am new to active
development, implementations may be incorrect (ie using wrong interface); this project is in active
development and the intention is to complete the project core components by January 15th. Development
suspended Dec 27 - Jan 2 as I am attending a conference.
